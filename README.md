Españordle tracks your play streak as well as your win streak. The primary aim is not to win, but to gain new vocabulary, increase your exposure to spanish, and build a daily language learning habit.

There are two españordles released each day:
- Daily - vocab range from beginner to advanced (but nothing too obscure)
- Easy - a beginner-friendly mode limited to basic vocab

## About

Españordle is built with Next.js and Supabase. The audio and definitions are sourced primarily from the [Merriam-Webster Spanish-English Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-spanish-dictionary).
